# KMeans-Clustering---Machine-Learning-Project



The project takes the 20Newsgroup dataset, which contains 20,000 newsgroup documents partitioned between 20 newsgroups. 
Firstly, the data is preprocessed in order to imagine the term- recurrence dispersion. Then the archives are verctorized utilizing BoW, TF-IDF, LDA, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec models. 
Once the vector representation of the archives is obtained, clustering is done using the K-Means Model. 
The gensim and sklearn modules were mainly used for training the models and performing clustering respectively.
